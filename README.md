<strong>Brainstorming ideas:</strong>

<strong>Use blockchain to store genetic information of patient.</strong>
</br>Why?
Genes of patients can tell:
1. If they are predisposed to addiction 
2. Predisposed for other illnesses (diabetes, heart conditions, etc)
3. Which medications and at what dosage works better for them 
4. (This will also pave the way for research into epigenetics and immunotherapies!)

Features: 
1. open api that can be easily integrated with existing electronic health records
2. Alerts the doctor when they input a medication in the EHR if that medication is “right” for that patients genome
For ex. If they prescribe opioids and the patient has gene for addiction, the doctor will receive an alert like “Be careful!” or “Consider using this instead” or “Limit dosage to” 
3. Secure data and ease of sharing between providers bc it uses blockchain

<strong>Use blockchain to track medication dispenser and basic vitals of patient</strong>
</br>Features:
1. Create a pill dispenser to dispense one opioid at designated times
2. Each dispense will be recorded on the blockchain, as well as patient vitals when dispense occurs like heart rate, temperature, alcohol breathalizer 
3. Alerts doctors/family members if the patients vitals at the time of a dispense is awry
<br> The data collected could be useful for research into addiction
