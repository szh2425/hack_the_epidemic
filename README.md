# hack_the_epidemic

This project was bootstrapped from an existing web application from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The original code for the project is open source and free to use, as long as credit is given to the original source.

<strong>Use encrypted to store genetic information of patient and use blockchain to store transaction of database to prevent doctor shopping by patients</strong>
</br>Why?
Genes of patients can tell:
1. If they are predisposed to addiction 
2. Predisposed for other illnesses (diabetes, heart conditions, etc)
3. Which medications and at what dosage works better for them 
4. (This will also pave the way for research into epigenetics and immunotherapies!)

Features: 
1. open api that can be easily integrated with existing electronic health records
2. Alerts the doctor when they input a medication in the EHR if that medication is “right” for that patients genome
For ex. If they prescribe opioids and the patient has gene for addiction, the doctor will receive an alert like “Be careful!” or “Consider using this instead” or “Limit dosage to” 
3. Secure data and ease of sharing between providers bc it uses blockchain
